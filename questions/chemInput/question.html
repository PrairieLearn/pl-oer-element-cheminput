    Questions below were designed to showcase the different features of
    <code>pl-chem-input</code> The goal of
    <code>pl-chem-input</code> is to allow users to enter
    <b>chemical equation</b>. The correct answer in all questions below is
    2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) -> 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g).

    The states of matter will not be graded unless stated otherwise. Including
    them when they are not graded will not cause you to lose points, but you will 
    be penalized for excluding them when they are graded.

        The following demonstrates the default behavior of the
        <code>pl-chem-input</code> element. This example illustrates
        a question with a weight of 1 and a placeholder text set to "Your answer
        here." The <code>allow-blank</code> attribute is set to
        <code>false</code>, requiring students to provide an answer before
        submission. Additionally, the help text is displayed, and the editor's
        default size is set to 100, spanning the entire line. The score badge
        will appear once the "Submit Answer" button is clicked.

        This question demonstrates the use of different sizes for the
        <code>pl-chem-input</code> element on the page. Specifically,
        the input field in this example is configured with the
        <code>size="50"</code> attribute, resulting in a width of 50%.
        Additionally, the weight assigned to this question is higher compared to
        the preceding ones with configuration of <code>weight="5"</code>. Lastly,
        the <code>grade-states="true"</code>attribute will ensure that the states of
        matter are graded as well.

        This question demonstrates the functionality of the
        <code>allow-blank</code> attribute. In this example, the configuration
        <code>allow-blank="true"</code> permits the question to be submitted
        with a blank response. Additionally, the <code>include-feedback="false"</code>
        attribute will prevent feedback from being displayed.

        This question showcases the <code>prefill</code> functionality of the
        <code>pl-chem-input</code> element. In this example, the
        input field is pre-configured with the attribute
        <code>prefill="H_2O -> H_2 + O_2"</code>. Additionally, the help text is
        disabled, as specified by the
        <code>show-help-text="false"</code> attribute. Lastly,
        the <code>grade-states="true"</code>attribute will ensure that the states of
        matter are graded as well.

        This question highlights the <code>directory</code> and
        <code>source-file-name</code> functionalities of the
        <code>pl-chem-input</code> element. In this example, the
        input field is configured with the attributes
        <code>directory="source"</code> and
        <code>source-file-name="part5"</code>. The corresponding source file
        contains the content <code>H_2O -> H_2 + O_2</code>. Additionally, the
        <code>show-score</code> attribute is set to <code>false</code>,
        preventing the score badge from being displayed.
